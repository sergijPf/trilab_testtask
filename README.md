# trilab_testtask
Added wizard to Menu in Inventory application.
It allows:
- to remove "single-valued" product attributes ('to-' needs to remain empty in wizard view);
- to replace "single-valued" product attributes with a different ones;
- to replace attribute value within "configurable attributes" without re-creating/removing product variants (from- and to- attribute must be the same)
- replacing/removing will be done only once per one product
